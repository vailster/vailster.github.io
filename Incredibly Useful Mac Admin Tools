I thought I'd do a little post linking to some of the tools I've found really helpful throughout the years in managing macOS devices. Enjoy!

### Installomator

This shell script was a game changer for me. It provides a programatic way to download a thrid party macOS app from the vendor's website and install it on the device. The list of available apps has grown and the options for notifications just keep getting better. Certainly beats the hinky pop ups I was doing originally with jamfhelper :D
