![The front entrance of the Museum of London's Barbican location in the early evening winter light]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/media/IMG_20221123_165441.jpg)

This week a friend and I made a pilgramage to have one last visit to the Museum of London. It will be closing its doors on the 4th of December to start preparing to move to its new location in Smithfield. 

Lots can be read about the new museum [here](https://museum.london/)

First off, I got **a lot** of photos of the outside as this corner of the Barbican is slated to be [heavily redeveloped](https://www.archpaper.com/2021/12/office-tower-studded-vision-unveiled-for-museum-of-london-redevelopment-site/).
