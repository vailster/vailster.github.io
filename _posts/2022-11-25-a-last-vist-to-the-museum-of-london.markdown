This week a friend and I made a pilgramage to have one last visit to the Museum of London. It will be closing its doors on the 4th of December to start preparing to move to its new location in Smithfield. 

Lots can be read about the new museum [here](https://museum.london/)

First off, I got **a lot** of photos of the outside as this corner of the Barbican is slated to be [heavily redeveloped](https://www.archpaper.com/2021/12/office-tower-studded-vision-unveiled-for-museum-of-london-redevelopment-site/).

Once inside, we fell into that classic trap of spending ages on the first few galleries, only to realise the time and having to hurry through the last few. I may not have taken photos of everything, but I saw a lot of favourite displays and objects.

**The large wall at the back of the entrance area had a farewell message**

**Looking down to the now closed cafe area. They had the best Great of 1666 cupcakes back in 2016 to tie in with the exhibit and anniversary of the fire.**

**Sharp bits, as well as a replica of the [Battersea Sheild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea_Shield) in the 'London before London' gallery.
